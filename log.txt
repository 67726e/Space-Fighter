	supposed to.

	the player scores one point. Possible modifications

==========
12/12/2010
-- Updated Threat Assesment
	Threat assesment is a little less cautious. The missile
	can now travel farther without triggering the threat levels.
	This makes it easier to hit the enemy but still allows for dodging
	and tactical assesment of the situtation.
-- Added Missile Limits
	Players can now only fire designated amount of missiles per round.
	1 EMP, 2 Trackers. Infinite missiles can always be fired.
==========
12/10/2010

	the side.

	The game now dispalys the amount of lives the user currently
	has. It starts off at 3.
-- Added Lives Updater
	Whenever the player is struck by a missile, the lives will need
	to be updated. SR_UpdateLives is the subroutine to do this.
=========
12/8/2010
-- Added Enemy Missile Hits
	When a missile is fired at the enemy ship and the missile
	strikes on the ship, a hit is detected. At this point the missile
	stops moving, the tile is set to blank, and the threat level is reset
	back to 0.
=========
12/7/2010
-- Added Threat Levels
	The current threat level for the enemy ship is calculated 
	based on the location of the enemy missile. 0 indicates
	no missiles firing, 1 indicates missile fired, 2 indicates
	missile moving in (mid-range) and 3 indicates a missile hit
	is close.
-- Added Basic AI
	The AI assesses the threat level and the location of the incoming missiles
	and moves accordingly either left or right will still respecting the bounds
	set by the 'walls'.
=========
12/6/2010
-- Added Wall Collision
	Checks the ship's position. If the user is past the extreme
	boundary, the ship is reset to this boundary. Currently only
	supports the left and right walls as well as the bottom edge
	and sets the top limit near the bottom of the enemy ship.
-- Added in Select Limitations
	The player cannot change the missile ID during a missile launch.
	If a player were able to do so, he or she could change the effects
	of the missile mid-flight. Also, the player may no longer switch
	missiles while paused. This reserves the Select button's use for
	a possible paused menu.
=========
12/5/2010
-- Added 'PAUSED' text
	Whenever the game is paused, the text 'PAUSED'
	will be displayed. When the game is unpaused, the
	text is removed.

	Now the button reacts instantly to a press instead
	of waiting until the user releases the button. Player
	must release the button and press it again for the
	action to repeat.
-- Allow Vertical Movement
	Player can now move ship up and own
	by presseing the respective buttons.
	Updated the missile code to get the
	vertical position of the ship. Also
	updated missile code to set limit.
	Missile's vertical position can not be
	less than 8.
-- Added Missile Numbers
	Numbers displaying the current number of missiles sits
	above the respective missiles now. They are part of the
	background and will need to be changed based on missile
	firings.
=========
12/4/2010
-- Added in game text
	'SCORE' and 'LIVES' added
	Loads after 'LoadsBackground:'
	Data after 'Background:'
-- Moved around enemy position and 'walls'
	Enemy now closer to top of screen
	'walls' now closer together (less playing space)
-- Purified NMI
	No longer have player ship/missile movement update
	login within NMI. Have them within Subroutine area
-- Missile Sprite Disappears
	Now when missile moves out of range, it will
	change the missile's tile number to a blank tile
-- Added in missile toggle
	When the player pressed 'Select' the next missile
	is selected but only when a missile is not firing
	Whenever the missile ID equals 3, it is time to go
	back to the standard missile (0)
-- Added Missile Selector Icons
	Now when the player selects a missile
	the current missile will be underlined
	by a small icon.
-- Added missile movement for 'Tracker Missile'
	Missile now moves based on the location of the enemy
	ship. If it is past it, the missile will either increment
	or decrement to get within the ship's boundaries.
-- Added EMP missile function
	Missile detonation is based on a value that increments
	with each NMI and it then exclusive or'd a few times
	I need a better random generator but this works fairly
	well for now.
=========
12/3/2010
-- Added in basic missile shooting
	One missile may be shot at any given time
	Missile may be fired when it detonates (via collision)
	or passes by the enemy.
